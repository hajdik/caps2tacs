1. aim.input.* attributes are static, how to change the thicknesses later?? :

After I store the the dictionaries DVdict and PropertyDict in nastranAIM.input.(attribute), I am unable to change the thicknesses that show up in the .dat file. It seems the .input attributes are constants, and I need a way to change the thickness from iteration to iteration. For example, here are following lines of code that could be added to CAPS capability.

	#this would change the initial value of the DVdict
	tacsAIM.desvar[DVname].value = newThickness

	#this would change the thickness of the PSHELL card
	#or we could have this PSHELL thickness change as the DV changes (better)
	tacsAIM.property[capsGroup]["membraneThickness"] = newThickness

2. The DVPREL1 and DESVAR first entries don't match because of trailing zeros.

	DESVAR x # # # #
	... skip some lines
	DVPREL1 y # # # #
	DVPREL1 z # # # #
	
	where with a large number of thicknessDVs, you end up with x and z matching, but y has trailing zeros (see stiffPanel3.dat). When in fact, we should have x=y=z
	
	DESVAR 11 # # # #
	...skip some lines
	DVPREL1 1100 # # # #
	DVPREL1 11 # # # #
	
	This is just a small bug probably.
	
3. The geometric or CSM despmtr variables don't work in the NastranAIM at all, so if you port the NastranAIM code over you have to add the ability for geomDVs back in.

Making geomDVs (supported by tacsAIM, not nastranAIM):

	desvarDict = {"name1" : {}, "name2" : {}, ... }
	aim.input.Design_Variable = desvarDict

	which produces in the bdf:
	
	DESVAR desvarID1 name1 0 0 0 ...
	DESVAR desvarID2 name2 0 0 0 ...
	
Making thicknessDVs (supported by NastranAIM, not tacsAIM):

	desvar_i    = {"groupName" : capsGroup_i,
              "initialValue" : thickness_i,
              "lowerBound" : thickness_i*0.5,
              "upperBound" : thickness_i*1.5,
              "maxDelta"   : thickness_i*0.1,
              "fieldName" : "T"}
    desvarDict = {"name1" : desvar_1, "name2" : desvar_2, ... }
	aim.input.Design_Variable = desvarDict
	
	which produced the correct results in the BDF (except for the trailing zeros from #2).
